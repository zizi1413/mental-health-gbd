Global mental health analysis using Python and Tableau (GBD 1990–2019)
This project analyzes the global burden of mental health disorders using data from the Global Burden of Disease (GBD) Study (1990–2019).

Python was used for data cleaning and exploratory analysis to prepare analysis-ready datasets. 
The cleaned outputs were then used to build the final analytical dashboard in Tableau.
